 Galaxy M33 5G, we have come to the box and you will be able to see that the adapter is not in it. So now, in actual budget and mid-range phones, this trend has come. But let's see, this is a very interesting phone. It has a 6,000 milli ampere battery. It's a big battery with 5nm processor. Wow, and if you look at its price, it is Rs. 25,000. And this is the 5G phone. Let's start. Like so, let's start. But you should also finish immediately. Like, subscribe if you don't. Right up front, big phone, it looks very serious. And it looks tall. Oh, it's... Let's see, let's talk about it. Nothing else. Flatbox, phone is here. And... All right. Sim card tool. And I guess there will be documentation. Documentation. All right. USB Type-C to Type-C cable is here. And there is no adapter. This means, if you support 25W, if you buy an adapter, that will cost you about Rs. 400-500. So, you must add it in the price. Let's look at the phone. Phone looks good. Let's remove this. Oh! Actually, it looks good. This finish, I would say, is satin finish. And I like it. Even if you are looking at the camera module, it is fused. It doesn't look like a joint or it is more on top. This is getting into fashion. This is coming into fashion. Overall, the look, it feels premium. If you talk about this feeling, this is a big phone. And heavy, it looks like a dance. It looks well made. It looks like a mirror, but you can see the weight. If you talk about the weight, then this should be 110 grams. Let's see. 215 grams probably. 215.1. Wow! I am getting much better. 215 grams is so slightly on the weightier side. But let's go. Let's see the price. This is not the case. Okay. Nothing. Nothing. Oh my goodness. Nothing is happening. The glass looks like this. But it is a plastic bag. The front is like a 5-cup protection. Let's start the phone. If you talk about the display, Actually, I have not written the M8 screen with the Sajit. No. It is not the T-R-T-F-P. It is not the M8. Because if you look at the side angles, Very good. Colors look very nice. Body screen is 6.6 inch. FHD plus screen is 120 hertz. Fast refresh rate is coming. And if I talk about brightness, It is quite bright. Brightness is also good. But let's say something. Water drop is not good. So, it looks a bit dated. You can see it from the top. Talking about ports, The side mounted fingerprint sensor comes from the bottom. It has a 3.5 mm USB type C. You get a noise-canceling microphone on top. On the left side, the SIM card is on top. The one on top, The one on top, Oh! Very nice. Dedicated SD card slot is available. It means that you will be able to use a SIM card and a SD card. Not bad.

It has updated the major updates. You will get 13 and 14. And 4 years of security updates. And as you know, One UI is very, very nice. You don't get much bugs. You get security for this. You get a knock security. An added extra layer of security for your data. So, it is all TZ, secure folder. So, all these features come on this. One interesting feature is, Voice Focus. It means, You are talking on the phone on a crowded place. And there are more voices. So, it is basically, It is shut down. So, that you are talking on the phone, So, that you are talking on the phone. Virtual RAM comes on this. This is next level. The one that says RAM plus. Basically, it has an 8GB variant. So, you will get an 8GB variant. 6GB variant is 6GB. So, it is double the RAM. But, it is virtual. By the way, You get 6128 coverage about RAM and storage. The base is 8128. You have a 2.2 storage. LPDDR4X RAM. 6000 milliampere battery. 6000. And then, Club it with Exynos 1280 processor. 5 NM base processor. And this processor, The A53 processor, It was in the 1430,000. But, Exynos 1280 processor. It is 5G processor. 5 NM base. This battery, You will get a 2-day, Ordered usage. I am very happy that we have come to 2 days. With battery. 6000 milliampere battery. Basically, Exynos 1280 processor. 5 NM base processor. It is 5G processor. Mali G68. It is GPU. And, If you talk about performance, On paper, you will get 4-5. So, it looks quite good. By the way, Talking about gaming performance, It would be better if it was a 3-2. Because, You can play HD-High settings. It is a smooth gameplay. 30 FPS is a frame rate. It is quite good. But, If you talk about CODM, You can play in very high settings. And, yes, Overall, I do not have any complaints. And, Multimedia, I have a very big display. Very bright, Very colorful display. And, Even though mono speakers are loud and quality is very good. So, COS speakers are good, But, mono are not bad at all. They are good. Talking about sensors, All sensors are on the side, The fingerprint sensor, And, 5G connectivity, It is the support of 12 bands. So, that is good dual 4G-VLT, Wi-Fi-Calling support.
