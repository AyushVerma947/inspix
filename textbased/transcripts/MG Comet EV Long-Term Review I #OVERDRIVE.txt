 Well, I've been driving the MG Commit for almost nine months now and here are a couple of things you should know about this quirky car. Here's a long-term review of the MG Commit. Well, I really like the auto-unlock function in the MG Commit. As you can see my hands are always full on it. I find it very difficult to find the car keys with all these bags, but you know what, I can't really access the car from this side. It's also very simple to access the car from the passenger side and I'll show you why. As you can see there is no central transmission tunnel, so you can very easily slide into the passenger side seat and slide over to the driver side seat. But once you step inside the cabin, of course getting access to the seatbelt is quite a task because this is a two-door hatch and it starts from right at the end of the door, this large door, but this one hook right here makes things much easier for the driver side seat. I wish that courtesy was extended to the passenger side seat as well. Well, once you get inside the cabin, it looks quite premium and good looking and you have this sleek dual infotainment screen as well with cool graphics, but this tends to hang a lot and the biggest learning for me has been that you have to keep track of the ODA of you. As you can see it's a tall car so not very comfortable for older people, but let's figure out whether it's comfortable for younger folks. Well, you get great visibility thanks to the tall hatchback. One thing that I don't like about the comment is that the brake and the accelerator pedals are in somewhat a raised position which makes it very uncomfortable while driving over a longer distance. I like that there is no start-stop button. All you have to do is press on the brake, shift from YouTube to drive and you can start driving. Also enhancing visibility at night are these powerful LED headlamps quite a boon in this comment. As you can see the comment doesn't really have what it can call a boot space and it has no space to even house a spare tire, but what it gives you instead is a tire inflator kit which is very handy if you have a puncture. I love how compact this MG comment feels and also this large last house. It really helps when you want to take quick turns in traffic, maneuver gracefully through these narrow biolins as well as park in tight spots. And while I really like this large glass house, a real big mist from MG is maybe a real windshield wiper as well as a washer and maybe even a rear-ding fogger that's something that you really need during the monsoons. A common complaint that we had even during our reviews was that the tires are really skinny and you do end up feeling the bumps on the road. So just to give you an idea about my daily commute I end up traveling around 20 kilometers. And I have to charge the comment once in four to five days with my AC home charger which is around 7.4 kW. But the comment that I have is a slow charging one which ends up using only around 3.3 kW AC charging. So it costs me approximately 54.42 rupees every time I plug in this car for a charge and that comes up to around 272 rupees per month. That's a lot of money saved, right? When you want to comment you have to plan your parking pretty wisely and that's simply because the doors of the commit are pretty wide. So in case you have a passenger sitting in the back seat it's not going to be very easy to let the person out. So you have to ensure that you're parked in a spot where it's much easier for your passenger to head out. The service has been pretty smooth with the MJ comment. In fact MJ gives you 8 year battery warranty and if you want to consider this a gadget which charges you around 54 rupees per charge and saves you a ton of money while you're doing so 8 years is a very good bargain don't you think? The recent value is a big question mark when it comes to electric vehicles in our country but if MJ were to decide to give you a discounted rate to upgrade to another EV when it's time to sell the commit it would be a great option wouldn't it? So it's something for MJ to think about but for now the MJ comment is the most affordable EV you can buy in the country today and you might want to choose this as your second or third vehicle not the primary one to take you around the city. So in that respect I would give the comment a big thumbs up.
