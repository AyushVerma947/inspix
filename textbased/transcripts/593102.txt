 Hey everyone, this is my Nexon EV which has done over 26,000 kilometers and I have taken it to almost every place where I would take my diesel cars to, beat the highways, the mountains, the lakes or beaches. So this is a long term EV car ownership video in which I will talk about the different aspects of driving an EV in India like how the home charging setup works, how to charge when on long trips, how to plan for long trips, maintenance and servicing and most importantly about range anxiety. So this video will basically help you understand if an EV is the right option for you and what are the benefits, challenges that you'll face while driving an EV. So let's get started. So with respect to the home charging setup, the installation was done free for me by Tata and at that time they provided 10 meters of free cable along with that I also got this charging box which has a lock on it and I think if you're staying in apartments this locking mechanism is very important. You also get this charging cable along with the car which has a 16 ampere plug on one side and the other side has a connector that will connect to your car's charging port. So this is a slow charger that you know it's a 3 kilowatt charger and it will charge the car slowly. So for my car it takes around 8 to 9 hours to completely charge from 0. And this is the kind of port that's there on the car and you can plug the gun in here and once the power supply is turned on the main control unit has some straight slides that will show that the charging has begun. Apart from the control unit the charging information is also shown inside the car on the dashboard where it will show how much the car is charged and approximately you know how much more time it will take to charge it to 100%. So after a while here you can see that the charging is almost done. It's also showing the approximate real time range that I will get with the current battery charging percentage and once it's completely charged the charging gets automatically cut off as well. Now let's talk about the fast charging experience where public charges and you know this has been a mixed experience for me because not every time things go well. So let's discuss this in detail. Now firstly finding charges on the go is quite easy as there's a very good app called Plug Share and this also has an Android Auto Integration. So you know you can search charges on the go on the cars infotainment system itself and using this you can either search via location or find nearby charges and once you find something you can use the navigation feature in this that will get you the directions to the charger. So this part is I would say very easy and after that comes the slightly tricky bit. So let's see what happens next. Now in some cases you'll end up at fast chargers set up at petrol pumps and if the petrol pump has a convenience store it's you know easy to spend time. Otherwise it becomes a bit difficult to pass time while your car is charging and it becomes even more challenging if you have your family with you because you all need to step out while the car is getting charged and then the question is like what to do while the car is getting charged. So that's like a tricky thing I would say. Another small issue is with all these different apps that you need to install. So basically every company that has their chargers set up on the road have their own mobile app and since you do not have much choice while doing road trips you'll end up installing a lot of different apps and at times when you're like at a very new location and you're installing the app for the very first time it gets a bit frustrating because you're because you have that sign up page and then at times there is mobile OTP authentication. So if the network on your phone is not good you won't get the OTP you won't be able to use the app and you'll have to install it on somebody else's phone. So that's a bit tricky at times it doesn't happen 95% of the time but there is a chance of that happening and some of these apps have like I would say 5% of these apps have their own wallet integration. So they'll ask you to install a specific wallet application and then you can add funds into the charging app. So I think that's a bit of a problem. That's not the case with all the apps but 95% of the apps support multiple payment options like UPI, Netbanking, Credit Card etc. But in some apps you have to install an additional wallet app. So that's a bit of a problem. And lastly to sum it up when you install 4 different apps you'll be adding money into all of these 4 apps and let's say that you pay only half of what you've added. Then the rest of the money sits in the app until you use the charger the next time. So I think there should be some unified app which will list down all these providers and you should be able to use it that way. So I don't know if somebody is working on an improvement but that's an improvement area for these charging apps. Now the charging guns at fast chargers are different than your home charging gun. So at most places you'll find these CCS type 2 guns which are universally compatible with all new EV cars. And once you get the charger plugged in and the charging started via the app the car gets charged pretty quickly. Now this again depends on how much fast charging your car supports. For example if you're using a 60 kWh charger and your car supports only 24 kWh of fast charging then that's the only power it will consume. So if someone is driving a car like a Kia EV6 that supports up to 350 kWh fast charging. And if the charger is that fast the car will get charged like pleasingly fast. But in general for normal users who will be buying average EVs it would take something around 50 minutes to 1 hour for the car to get completely charged from 10% back to level. And about the cost for charging so this again differs from company to company. At some chargers it will be as cheap as Rs 16 per kilowatt and at some it's as expensive as Rs 24 per kilowatt. So to give you an average value if you charge your car via fast chargers only then the running cost would be around 3 to 4 rupees per kilometer. And if you're charging it at home it will go down to like 1 or 1 and a half rupees per kilometer. And if you have a solar setup at home then there's nothing like it. Now let me talk a little bit about the driving experience which in my opinion is far more superior than any IC car. And trust me on this once you buy an EV you'll probably never go back to a conventional fuel car. Now the first reason for this is region braking which is extremely helpful when you're going downhill. And 90% of the time if you plan and release your accelerator properly you will not have to use the brakes. So basically how this works is as soon as you lift your feet from the accelerator it will slow down the car depending on the region level that you've selected. And while doing it it also recharges the battery. Another thing that blows my mind is the no noise factor. As there's no engine noise the cabin is very quiet and you will not have to shout while talking to your fellow passengers which you know you have to do in diesel cars mostly. So even when comparing it to a petrol car the the EVs are quite silent and this feels very peaceful while driving the car. Now let's talk about range anxiety which is the most common topic on EV forums. And in my two years of using this car there have been two instances two to three instances where I got this range anxiety feeling. So with EVs you need to plan your trip properly and check for charging stations before you head out on a long trip and you need to plan your brakes accordingly. So this I don't know I think it's a positive thing because it makes you a better trip planner but in general if the battery percentage goes below 10% it is going to make you anxious until you get to the next charging station. So I think as long as you plan properly it's not going to be a problem and the car that I have is not an extended range one it's the basic one so for me I need to plan carefully but if you're getting an EV which has 350 km plus of range then I think this planning part can be a little here and there but if you have a low range EV then you definitely need to plan better. And for an adventure seeker like me when I take my car outdoors I need to plan carefully and have enough range so that even if there is some blockage in the road I should be able to make back to the nearest charging station. So it could be like a tree has fallen down on the road or if there's a landslide I need to make sure that there's enough range for me to go back to a different charging station. That's a consideration if you plan to take your EV outdoors. Now about the maintenance and servicing this part has also been a mixed experience for me and here you can see in the engine bay things are less complicated as compared to a normal IC car and there's just an electric motor some coolance and other electrical modules. So definitely there's less maintenance compared to an IC car and it's very rare that you'll face any major issues. However what I felt is a little bit off is the servicing cost because it's not what I had expected so for minus servicing it cost me 2448 rupees which is absolutely good but for the major servicing it cost me around 5,824 rupees so which in my opinion is slightly on the higher side. I don't know I mean they they had to change something called as a transaxial oil which was like the the major contributor in the service bill for for the major servicing. So somehow I felt that this is on the higher side because you know we have a thinking that this is an EV car and there's no oil change involved. So this was not the typical engine oil as such but some other oil I'm not sure what exactly it is in terms of mechanical terms but yeah it was some kind of an oil that needed replacement and here you can see that you know in this bill it is the highest contributor. So at a 15k interval I had to shell out like 6000 rupees approximately and that I felt is slightly on the higher side. Apart from that regularly there are absolutely no issues at all. So on that part I feel EVs are absolutely great. So given all the pros and cons that I've discussed so far I would say that my experience with an EV has been good and this is in terms of saving money on road trips and the driving comfort and I'm not just saying this I have another diesel car in my garage which has done over like 1.25kms and I know what a car should have. So as a personal suggestion to anyone looking out to buy an EV I would suggest that you choose something that suits your travel requirement. So let's say if you're traveling only within the city then a less range car would do but if you plan to travel to far away places then definitely go for a long range EV. And apart from this apart from the points that I've covered if you have any questions on your mind then you can definitely put those down in the comments section below and I'll answer them as soon as possible. So that's it for this one guys I hope you like this video if you do then give it a like and also subscribe to my channel. Thank you.
