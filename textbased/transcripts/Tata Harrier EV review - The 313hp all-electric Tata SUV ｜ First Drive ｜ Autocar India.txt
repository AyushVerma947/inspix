 But now you probably know a lot about the electric Harrier. You know the pricing it starts on 21 to 30 Lakh rupees which is a very good price. You've seen it outside and in. You've even seen what it can do off road. The only thing left is what's it like to drive on road. So today let's get straight to that and let me summon the Harrier EV for you. Yes the electric Harrier has a summon mode which though I have to say does not move very smoothly but it's one of the many cool driving features so let's get straight out onto the road. The motor setup well the front is a 158 horsepower induction motor. The rear is a 238 horsepower. Synchronous motor. Now don't add the two up because that's not actually how they work. Quite often manufacturers don't let both motors give out max power and that's sometimes for handling and balance but also because of in this case the EV the battery discharge rate so the discharge rate of this battery cannot support all of those horses together. So the total system power is 313 horsepower still plenty. And that Tata says can propel it from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in a very quick 6.3 seconds and in our initial run we got 6.67. The brakes though aren't as quick in bringing it to a halt and I would have liked a better pedal feel too. In terms of the motor setup the rear is the main motor so in a two wheel drive variant of the Harrier EV you will have the motor only on the rear of course in the four wheel drive you've got obviously both. The rear motor does most of the driving works so for example right now I'm driving just steadily cruising along at around 60 kilometers but it's only the rear motor that is working. If you put your foot down like this then you'll find the front motor also comes into aid that acceleration and have a smoother takeoff so your wheels aren't sort of scrabbling for power or braking traction. The motors are also very silent and on the whole driving refinement is good. Now the battery on this four wheel drive version is a 75 kilowatt hour battery and Tata claims there's a 622 kilometer range on the MIDC cycle. Though they also have what they call the C75 range which is basically based on their customers' driving data they think that 75% of customers should see around 490 kilometers so that's a real lot and more than enough for everyday use. On our shoot day we got a 436 kilometer range which is impressive. Charging too pretty quick on a 120 kilowatt DC fast charger it can go from 20 to 80% in about 25 minutes. Now the Harrier gets drive modes of course you've got eco, normal and sport as also a boost mode for you know quick acceleration or an overtake and what's nice is that the calibration and all modes is really really spot on. In fact right now we're crawling as you can see in some traffic. I'm in city mode it's absolutely fine I'm going to move to sport yeah sport mode and even now it's not head trigger sharp the throttle and I like that because this is a family SUV at the end of the day and it doesn't need that head trigger response ultra light throttle so you know it's it's just perfectly calibrated. If you do want to get a move on when things clear out, flow the throttle and yeah you'll move off. It is on the heavier side so if you like that really light sort of throttle and you know tap it and it zooms off that's not what you'll have here and speaking of weight it's not just the throttle that's calibrated that way it's steering to it isn't super light so you know around let's say traffic or in tight parking spots there is some amount of effort that you do require but I would say it moves from medium to heavy it's not really light so in that sense for me I just like it. The other bit I like is that the AIDA calibration worked very well in a brief drive and there's even auto braking for low speeds that you can't turn on or off. Now with the move to electric motors, Tata has had to redo the rear suspension and it's an all independent setup and I have to say it's really really remarkable. Right quality over rough roads outstanding it just soaks up everything. You keep a steady pace over them and it's almost like there's a separate layer between you and the roads. Tata calls it ultra glide suspension and I normally hate marketing terminology because it's always overhyped but here I would give it to Tata because it does feel like you're gliding over broken surfaces and stripped away tarmac. Potholes yes you will feel them you know especially the sharp ones but for everything else you know rats and broken roads it's really really nice. It's also blind over the odd trail and there's a full range of traction modes which we will thoroughly test off-road so stay tuned to the AutoCa India channel. What's nice is that this doesn't come at the expense of handling so around corners for example like this you know slightly spirited cornering even if you were to push it a little harder. Body roll is well contained so that's really nice to see. The only area where I can see some criticism with the suspension is on a straight level road with some undulations. There is a little of float from the rear axle especially. Let's head to the rear seats then shall we? Now the right quality at the rear is just outstanding. Soaks up all of the imperfections on the road stripped away tarmac and things like that but on a road like this where there are sort of gentle crests and undulations you can feel that rear heaving up just a little bit so perhaps with it weighed down things would be a little better. Coming now to equipment levels. Now the rear it's fairly well-appointed so you've got a tray here for your phone two type C65 watt USB chargers and in case you want to cut the glare from outside and you're just sitting here baking in the sun you've got these handy sun blinds too. There's also a flip-down armrest with some cup holders here and what I really like to see is this these little extended wings for the head restraints so if you're catching a nap your head won't roll off. It's a little firm to press down or up but it's a nice handy touch to see really nice. I like that. Now seating posture. Well this is an EV so the first thing I wanted to see was how do you sit? Is it the me's up position and I'm happy to say it's not really. In fact if you look at me right now I've got my legs fairly level. The floor is flat as you can see here so I think Tata have done a good job of space packaging and there is decent amount of headroom above too there's about a four or five finger gap to the roof liner here. I'm five eight four reference. Now legroom there is a scooped out portion here for the seats but there's also this boss mode the two buttons here so if I want to liberate more room I can do that right from here at the rear and as you can see that's plenty of legroom and I can flip down you know the front as well there so gives you a nice and open feel. At the front too it's comfy and well equipped highlights are powered and cooled front seats with memory for the driver a 10.2 inch digital instrument panel and a center touch screen that Tata says is the first auto application of a Samsung OLED panel and it does look very clear. The inner rear view mirror also has a camera feed which is very smooth and absolutely lag free unlike though the 360 degree cameras which do stutter a bit. There's dual zone climate control with toggles for temperature but not so easy to use touch surfaces for other controls and on top of course there's the crowd favorite of panoramic sunroof. So let's take a quick tour around the outside now. As you've seen it is pretty much the harrier but there are a few small subtle changes like for example this grill area here it is actually sealed off and I'm quite happy to see that Tata despite having sealed off the grill area has kept these little grooves here so it gives it that air intake or a grill look I personally don't like the sealed off look so happy to see that here. The DRLs they're on top and extend into this light bar that go right across and you have the headlamps down below and of course down here is where you have all of the air intake for the cooling. Now this may share the top hat with the regular internal combustion harrier but Tata says the bottom half for the bottom floor is all new in fact they have an acronym for the new architecture they call it Tidal which is Tata Intelligent Digital Architectural Layer quite a mouthful but what that means of course is they've managed to package things in really quite nicely as we've seen you've got the front motor, the rear motor battery in between there the seating position quite natural and you also have a small front up here 17 kgs max is what it says and it's quite broad so you can put you know your charging cable for example if you want in here. At the rear too it's very familiar or territory but if you look on top at the shark fin antenna you'll notice there is a camera there and that's because it's feeding the inside of your mirror that you saw earlier you've got the spoiler here with a high mounted stoplight you've got the LED stoplights here that extend all across and of course the daytime running lamps as well and down below no exhaust pipes. Now since we're here at the rear let's take a look inside the boot. Tata says it's 502 liters of boot space that may see more than the regular diesel hadier but that's because 502 is up to the roof on the diesel hadier it's around 435 if I remember right but that is still a pass-al-trade this is actually a smaller boot only by a slight amount of noise you can see that's because of this raised flow here now the flow is raised not because of the battery that's of course between the front and the rear wheels the flow is raised because of the rear motor on the regular hadier it's a front wheel drive so there's no differential as well so they've had to make space for the motor which is down below and what I also like is that Tata has retained the spare wheel too so it's a space-saver spare but at least you have that so that has raised the flow a bit but I think that's a nice happy balance and for me that nicely sums up the electric hadier it's a great balance perhaps it should have had more wow factor than its i-cibbling but it still looks smart power isn't explosive but it's plenty and fed out in a nice and strong fashion the ride gets floaty overcress but over the rough stuff it's simply superb and body control is also very good the feature list may not be the lengthiest but it's got all the expected widths and a few more to and of course interior space and comfort is good and then uniquely in this segment it has the option of all wheel drive with prices from 21.5 to 29 likes it's more attractive reprised against its main rival the Mahindra XV90 so all in all the electric hadier strikes a very good balance
